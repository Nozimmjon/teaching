<h2>What is Git?</h2>

*** =left

- Git is a version-control software created by [Linus Torvald](https://www.linux.com/blog/10-years-git-interview-git-creator-linus-torvalds) (who also invented Linux)
- Git is used to manage versions of source code files without having to carry around files with names like `"my_code_v1_v2_FINAL.py"`

<h2>Setting Up Your Repo (pt 1)</h2>

A Git repository ("repo") is a collection of files that are tracked by Git. At a high level, setting up a repository involves the following steps:

1. Create some files
2. Initialize a git repository in the directory where you store the files
3. Tell Git to track some of the files

From the command line prompt (Git Bash for Windows users), run the following to create a sample directory and initialize a Git repository in it.

```
mkdir -p ~/repos/mu_rprog_files
cd ~/repos/mu_rprog_files
git init
echo "This repo holds my notes and scripts from R Programming class" > README.md
```

<h2>Setting Up Your Repo (pt 2)</h2>

Now we have a simple repository set up. Let's check out what's happening in it!

You can run `git status` to check the current status of your repo and `git ls-files` to list all the files being tracked in the repository.

<center><img src="./assets/img/week1_git_status.png"></center>

Even though we do have one file, `README.md`, in this directory, we haven't told Git to track it yet! This is why `git status` lists it as an untracked file and `git ls-files` returns nothing.

<h2>Setting Up Your Repo (pt 3)</h2>

Let's add that file to the repository! Git tracks *changes* to projects (rather than keeping entire copies of files), so we need to do the following to change the repo:

1. Make some changes (add/delete/edit files)
2. use `git add <file_name>` to *stage* your changes
    - translation: "tell Git we want to make this change, but don't make it permanent yet"
3. use `git commit -m "some text describing changes"` to *commit* your changes
    - translation: "make the changes permanent and create a checkpoint at this repo state"

See example terminal session on the next slide.

<h2>Getting Started with GitHub (pt 1)</h2>

- **Creating An Account**
    - head to https://github.com/ and create your account!
    - the free tier accounts are very good and will likely be more than you ever need, but note that premium and
    enterprise accounts are available if you need more advanced features

<h2>Getting Started with GitHub (pt 2)</h2>

- You can use GitHub (GH) as a hub to store [remote repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/about-remote-repositories/)
    - Primary purpose: allow others to contribute to and use your codebase
    - Secondary purpose: back up files in the cloud so you can access them from anywhere
- steps to create your first remote repository:
    1. Log in to GH and navigate to the "Repositories" tab and click "new"
    2. Choose a repository name (let's call ours "mu_rprog_files")
    3. Choose a privacy level ("Public" is fine for most cases) and click "Create Repository"

<h2>Getting Started with GitHub (pt 3)</h2>

- **Clone your remote repo**
    1. on your local machine, open up a command line session and use `cd` to switch to the directory where you want to store the repo
    2. grab the URL of the repo you want and use `git clone` to pull a copy.
    3. Change directories into the newly-created repo and run `git remote -v` to check that you have a remote set up

**In-Class Exercise**

```{r engine='bash', eval=F}
cd ~/repos
git clone https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify
cd slidify
git remote -v

# Add a remote for our mu_rprog repo!
cd ~/repos/mu_rprog_files
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mu_rprog_files
git push origin master
```
